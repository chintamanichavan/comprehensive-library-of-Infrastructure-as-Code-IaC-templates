In the `README.md` file, we have provided a brief description of the `storage` module, an example of how to use it in a Terraform configuration, and the output values that users can expect after creating an Amazon S3 bucket using this module. You can further enhance this `README.md` file with more details, examples, and best practices related to creating and managing S3 buckets in AWS using this module.
